# Overview

Grabber is a simple news reader that pulls in current news circling Trump from all english-speaking countries and displays it vertically.

Articles are shown with any available image, description, title and date.

Some tongue-in-cheek options for search refinement are given, as if to provide you with three wholly seperate perspectives.

# How to Use Grabber

Simply download and unpack the .zip file onto your machine, then open up the index.html.

All the code is there for you to mess around with and (quite naturally) improve.
