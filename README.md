# Responsive News Reader

I tired to do simple news reader where I fetch news from 'https://newsapi.org/v2/top-headlines'. I wanted to be looks very colorful so have many different bright colors on website so news not looks bad (even if they are).
I used mobile first approach and then create 2 versions: for tablets and for desktop users.
On beginning I use flexbox to arrange all boxes with news however, during this project I starting to learning 'CSS grid' so after that I rebuild code with 'CSS grid'.
